* Description
*UPDATE 3*: I am trying to generate a SQLAlchemy mode for the ~dim_date~ table, using SQLAcodegen

*UPDATE 2:* It looks like the SQL script works, so there is nothing to do here

*UPDATE:* I may just update the week-related columns with Python and leave the SQL logic intact.

After mucking about with a PostgreSQL script for generating a date dimension, I wasn't happy with how week numbers were handled, and Python seems to do it better.
